########### An Analysis of Different Recommendation Systems Using the MovieLens Dataset########################## Author## Tim Conze#### DescriptionIn this project we will explore the MovieLens dataset that includes 10 million rows of movie ratings. This dataset is a subset of the data that was collected by the GroupLens Research lab, located at the University of Michigan. Then, multiple recommender algorithms are build and evaluated.The goal of this project is to compare different recommender models based on their prediction accuracy, and ultimately compare them to the prediction accuracy achieved by the winning team of the "Netflix Challenge". For that, the RMSE will be used as error metric.#### Table of ContentsThis project includes the following scipts: 1. Downloading and wrangling the movielens data 2. Dataset preparation for model building 3. Initial data exploration 4. Models (Baseline Models/Regularized Models/Models with recosystem implementation) 5. Recommenderlab models in separate script 6. R Markdown PDF detailing the process and comparing models# The original dataset we are working with can be found in a separate file, titled "ml-10M100K”.# All plots and figures can be found by either exploring the "fig" file or :   Rec_sys_Pro_files -> figure-html5#### Notes on R Markdown:We use a template provided by cleanrmd. Since this output is html, we convert it to PDF after the fact. This can be done in a browser or by using "pagedown".The document can also be rendered as pdf directly or as standard html R Markdown document. The Tufte template was considered but subsubsections would have to be removed.### Hardware Used for Analysis:# Macbook Pro 23# Apple M2 with 16 GB Ram### Software Used for Analysis:# OS Darwin 20# Rstudio# Version 2023.06.0+421 (2023.06.0+421)#### Libraries used:These can also be found in the script "model-preparation"# "tidyverse"# "caret"# "lubridate"# "rmarkdown"# "dplyr"# "tidyr"# "ggplot2"# "stringr"# "scales"# # "widyr"# "knitr"# "gghighlight"# "RColorBrewer"# "kableExtra"# # "wordcloud"# # "doParallel"# # "recosystem"# # "recommenderlab"# "reshape2"# To install cleanrmd:# remotes::install_github("gadenbuie/cleanrmd")# To install pagedown:# remotes::install_github('rstudio/pagedown')############### Thank you for reading my project.
